A counter for the joke created by AlynxZhou.

## The Joke

- Chinese Version

	我看到 Hackghost 的桌面上有一个计数器，上面显示数字“233”，于是我好奇地去问他这个计数器代表什么意思。他回答说：“这个数字代表了我今天被蠢货们打断了工作的次数”。说完他又按了一下计数器按钮，于是现在数字变为“234”了。

- English Version Translated by AlynxZhou

	I saw a counter on Hackghost's desktop showing a number "233", and I asked him what it means curiously. He said "That represents how many times I was interrupted by idiots today". After speaking he pressed the button of counter again, and then the number became "234".

## Usage

Click the counter on the status bar to add 1 and count **WHAT THE FUCK** you want to count, including your coding hours, your drinking times, your fucking fucking times, your fucking fucking this counter times, etc.

It's a meta-counter that can count every thing you did with/without Atom, a hackable text editor for the 21st centery, with a fuckable counter.
